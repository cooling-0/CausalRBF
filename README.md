# Small dataset augmentation with radial basis function approximation for causal discovery using constraint-based method
- Causal analysis involves inference and discovery.
- However, identifying causal relationships in real-world datasets remains challenging
- We propose a model that generates a continuous function from available samples using radial basis function approximation.
- We address the problem by extracting data from the generated continuous function and evaluate the proposed method on both real and synthetic datasets generated by structural equation modeling
